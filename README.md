# California Mission Game
My daughter's California mission game (focused on San Juan Capistrano) with all the printable and 3d printable assets

# Why is this here?

My daughter invented a game about the San Juan Capistrano Mission. She put so much work into it, it seemed like something that might interest other kids, educators, and parents. Also, it's fun to play!

# What do I need to recreate the game?

At the simplest, you need:

* Normal printer (color preferable)
* Some posterboard
* Glue
* Scissors.

If you want to reproduce it just as you see in the pictures, you'll need:

## Hardware

* Color printer -- Printing the cards that were then folded over so they had a front and a back.
* 3D Printer -- We used a Luzbot Mini to print the dice, arches, and the individual playing pieces.
* Laminator -- Laminate the cards so they could survive dirty fingers

## Software

* Photo-viewing software -- All of the cards have been included as PNG files, so if you can load them into an image editor/viewer, you can print them from there
* Microsoft Powerpoint (for editing) -- If you want to directly edit the cards (or add more), the Powerpoint file is included
* Cura (or other 3D printing software) -- All of the models are included as STL files so any 3D printing software that can load or convert that format can use the files
* Blender (for editing) -- If you want to edit the 3D models, the Blender files for the dice, game pieces, and arches are included.

# How this game came about

My daughter has a school project based around the California missions. She decided to make a game around San Juan Capistrano and so she invented the game you find here. She would write the details for playing cards on index cards, test them out, and when she was happy she would type them into the computer. She would do the same with the board and the playing pieces.

I took these elements and put them into the computer. We laid out the card design in Powerpoint and them I wrote a small macro that took the text she wrote and duplicate a template card and inject the text she'd typed into the slides. Print, laminate, cut, and done!

For the board, she wanted something that looks like the mission that players could move around. She modeled it initially with cardboard and a hot glue gun. I took her cardboard prototypes, used the 3D program Blender to create the 3D models, and then printed them on our Lulzbot Mini 3D printer.
